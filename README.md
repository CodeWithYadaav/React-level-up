# React Mastery — 30 Days Challenge

A 30-day practical React.js learning journey by a backend **Node.js developer (4 years experience)** who is transitioning into full-stack development.

This repo contains:
- Daily tasks  
- Mini projects  
- Hooks practice  
- A full real-world Product Store App  
- Notes, learnings, and progress tracking  

The focus is **building**, not watching tutorials.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists
For the last year, I kept restarting React from scratch and never made consistent progress.  
This time, the goal is clear:

### **No restarting. Only incremental daily progress.**
This repo keeps me accountable.
